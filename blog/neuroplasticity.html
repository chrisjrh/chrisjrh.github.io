        <h1 style="color: white;">Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">This means modable brain and it states that the brain can change throughout life, it means if you are exposed to something enough you will learn it from the ability of your brain to modify and re-wire itself. For me to use neuroplasticity for my own benefit I believe going over the Javascript Course again would really help me remember certain terms and functions to allow myself to excel in coding. From reading google I found that exercise and video games can help aswell as eating avocado? A resourse that helped me learn about neuroplasticity was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWIagHUqD8A. This is a youtube video on the matter and was very insightful.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Growth Mindset is all about your mental attitude and making you believe you have the ability to improve. Its about not giving up if you fail but instead learning from failure and doing better the next time. I've always believed I have had a pretty good mental attitude so when I fail at something ofcourse its still frustrating however I like to believe I am able to learn from those mistakes. A resource that helped me with this task was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ.</p>
