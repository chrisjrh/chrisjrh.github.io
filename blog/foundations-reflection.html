        <h1 style="color: white;">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li>1. I learned that I find myself learning significantly faster and remembering stuff better when I have a video to work along side with.</a></li>
            <li>2. I found that its very hard to take on all the terms and words different coding languages use, going over a task twice helps me remember alot better.</a></li>
            <li>3. Also I'm not as good at coding as I thought I might be when started the foundations.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h1 style="color: white;">What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">Values in coding helped me get through the hard work as I kept reminidng myself that even if im stuck I need to keep working through it and not give up. Self awareness helped me keep on track and not get too ahead of myself when finding certain tasks easier than others.</p>
        <h1 style="color: white;">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">As I said in the Journal task above, I found myself surprised after reading through how much effort and work goes into creating code from scratch when reading through the Lib.JS file while working on minesweeper.</p>
        <h1 style="color: white;">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">The most challenging part of the core learning for me was the javascript fundamentals when working through all the terms. I found myself getting stuck very often and had to seek help on almost every question</p>
        <h1 style="color: white;">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">I believe we are spending alot of time on the basics/foundations because once all the students are used to the basics and understand them it will make learning the harder tasks significantly easier.</p>
        <h1 style="color: white;">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">I think the time spent learning the core aspects was not a waste at all. I personally believe I know have a decent understanding of the basics and learning the more complicated stuff from here should be alot easier with the knowledge I have now instead of going into it blind.</p>
