        <h1 style="color: white;">IDENTITY, VALUES AND STRENGTHS EXPLORATION</h1>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">When I was about 14 years old we had a family dog that had been living with us since I was a baby. He was struggling to go on walks and had many problems causing him to be in and out of the vet frequently. Eventually we agreed to have him put down. Obviously I didnt want to say goodbye to him however for his sake I knew it was the right decision to make.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">I was born and raised in Auckland. Over the years I have always been respectful of others and I am always striving to be as good as I can be at the task I am doing. </p>
        <h1 style="color: white;">USING THE EVIDENCE GATHERED, DESCRIBE YOUR STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS.</h1>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">One of my biggest strenghts is that when I am enjoying something I can dedicate almost all of my time to that task(also a bit of a weakness xD). I love learning new things and want to strive to be the best I can be. I'm a very good listener and pick up new skills well.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">My dedication will probably be my biggest strengh for my learning journey at Dev Academy. It will intersect with learning obstacles as when I get stuck on something ill spend how ever long it takes to figure out and understand the problem.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Recently during Sprint-1 I was trying to focus on the videos and learning about how to use GitHub while stuck in a room with someone also working from home due to covid. I was struggling to focus and it was impeding on my work. I asked them to move out of the room and was able to then focus fully on my work. This was very effective so if that senario were to take place again I would probably go with the same solution.</p>
