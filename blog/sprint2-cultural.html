        <h1 style="color: white;">Learning Plan</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">My long term goal is to one day have a job working with code and hopefully be a developer for the company.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">Some skills that I want to develop while at EDA are obviously learning all the different languages. However I also want to learn the best way to work from home and develop skills around time use.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">As listed in the <a href="https://chrisjrh.github.io/blog/sprint1-cultural.html">values</a> page my skills are as follows:</p>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li>Dedication</li>
            <li>Exploration</li>
            <li>Self Betterment</li>
            <li>Fast Learner</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white;">Some Limiations I have are:</p>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li>I struggle to fully focus on a task if im not enjoying it</li>
            <li>Dyslexia prevents me from sometimes getting my correct thoughts out into text</li>
            <li>I really love sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white;">I need to make sure that if I find myself getting a bit bored form the task at hand ill move onto a different task or take a break to prevent the work form seeming tedious or unenjoyable. If I do happen to get stuck on a subject the first thing I would do is seek help from my brother who has a lot of knowledge around coding, I would then turn to my facilitator at EDA being Emily or one of the slack channels.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">From the Faciliation team I would expect them to be able to help me out when needed on tasks provided to us.(they are doing a great job so far :D)</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">RECAP</h2>
        <h2 style="color: white;">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Hopefully in the future I will be able to obtain a job that I can enjoy doing based around working with computers and code. I hope to secure a job in a tech company working on creating software.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">My biggest strength will hopefully be that I am dedicated to learning how to code and always wanting to improve on my skills. My biggest limitation will be that I find it very hard to work long hours without losing focus, this didnt effect myself very much during foundations however I think it might during bootcamp.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">I believe as stated above keeping on track and not losing focus will be my biggest challenge during the bootcamp. I have always had a history of strugling to focus on tasks so hopefully with the new ways of breaking down work that I learned during Foundations I will be able to preform.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">I hope to develop a better Growth Mindset that will enable myself to always be learning and bettering myself</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">I hope the bootcamp team is understanding of my weaknesses and also very helpful with tasks I find myself stuck on just as what was happening during the Foundations</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">During Bootcamp I hope to prove myself and work harder than I ever have before to not only complete the tasks but also do them to a high quality of completion</p>
