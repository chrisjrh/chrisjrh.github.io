        <h1 style="color: white;">Learning Plan</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">My long term goal is to one day have a job working with code and hopefully be a developer for the company.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">Some skills that I want to develop while at EDA are obviously learning all the different languages. However I also want to learn the best way to work from home and develop skills around time use.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">As listed in the <a href="https://chrisjrh.github.io/blog/sprint1-cultural.html">values</a> page my skills are as follows:</p>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li>Dedication</li>
            <li>Exploration</li>
            <li>Self Betterment</li>
            <li>Fast Learner</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white;">Some Limiations I have are:</p>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li>I struggle to fully focus on a task if im not enjoying it</li>
            <li>Dyslexia prevents me from sometimes getting my correct thoughts out into text</li>
            <li>I really love sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white;">I need to make sure that if I find myself getting a bit bored form the task at hand ill move onto a different task or take a break to prevent the work form seeming tedious or unenjoyable. If I do happen to get stuck on a subject the first thing I would do is seek help from my brother who has a lot of knowledge around coding, I would then turn to my facilitator at EDA being Emily or one of the slack channels.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">From the Faciliation team I would expect them to be able to help me out when needed on tasks provided to us.(they are doing a great job so far :D)</p>
