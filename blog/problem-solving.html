        <h1 style="color: white;">Technical Blog - Problem Solving</h1>
        <h2 style="color: white;">A Problem I had this Sprint</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">I found trying to problem solve in repl.it was very frustrating and time comsuming after "Variables and Objects" becuase none of the other tasks had videos to go along with them and I find myself to be a massive visual learner. I quite often found myself stuff on the tasks however google and the example answers helped me get through these parts. I feel as though my understanding isnt as good however.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Pseudocode</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Pseudocode is a non technical but detailed description of code. Its a great way to seperate different parts of your code and look at them individually to help with figuring out the problem while not losing track of your goal.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Trying Stuff</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Of course theres always giving it a go to help with solving problems. I always find that if im stuck its often best to just attempt it and you might figure out how to solve it with the error codes or just by actually trying to get your ideas out into the code.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Console.Logging</h2>  
        <p style="color: white;">Console.log() is the best way I've found for myself when it comes to solving problems. Console.log() will log what ever you put into the brackets, into the console and this helps massivley when coding as quite often just looking at what you have coded without seeing the result might make you miss a few mistakes or realise you messed up something really stupid.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Googling</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">I believe I have used google to solve every single problem I have come across since I started coding haha. Google is fantastic as there are endless answers to questions and almost always you can eaisly find the help you needed to solve a problem.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Asking for help</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">I dont often ask for help but when I do its usually followed by a "Whoops missread this part sorry!". Asking for help usually makes me realise what I did wrong myself and its quite often something very stupid so its a bit embarassing haha.</p>
