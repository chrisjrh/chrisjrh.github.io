        <h2 style="color: white;">Differences Between HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">HTML: HTML covers all the text for a website and provides the links for anything like background pictures and visual exmaples, its basically all the core components of a website.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">CSS: CSS orders everything and sorts out the space between paragraphs, colours the text and picks the area/location of photos.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Control Flow Loops</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">A control flow loop is typically executed from top to bottom and are used to go through the stages of completing a task. For starting a car it would look like:</p>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li>Unlock car with key</li>
            <li>Open door</li>
            <li>Turn key in the ignition</li>
            <li>Car starts</li>
          </ul>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Explaining the DOM</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">DOM stands for: Document Objet Model, in basic terms it is the interface for web documents allowing you to change/adjust certain objects on a website and seeing them update in live time. You can use Shift-CTRL-I on google chrome to open it.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Differences between accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h2>  
        <p style="color: white;">Objects are a very powerful tool in Javascript and they basically are used for almost anything. Objects can store data for anything inside of Javascript</p>
        <p style="color: white;">Arrays are also Objects but the difference is that an Array stores data in an ordered fashion. In other words if you want to save data in sequential order you use and Array, if not you use an Object.</p>
        <h2 style="color: white;">What are Functions</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Functions are used to prevent repeating blocks of code by giving a set of instructions grouped together to calculate a specific outcome. You can call this function as many times as you want and only need the contents of the function to be written out once.</p>
